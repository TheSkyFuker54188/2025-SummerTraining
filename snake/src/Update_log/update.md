I'll implement the food collection strategy improvements as outlined in the `智能食物.md` file. Let's start by creating a new unified food processing function and then make the necessary adjustments to the risk evaluation and competition analysis.
Now let's update the `judge` function to use our new unified food processing function instead of the multiple `enhancedFoodProcessByPriority` calls:
Now let's also update the remaining part where we still use `enhancedFoodProcessByPriority` to maintain consistency:
Let's modify the risk assessment in `enhancedFoodProcessByPriority` to make it consistent with the new dynamic approach (in case it's still called from other places in the code):
Now let's also enhance the distance factor calculation and add food clustering bonus to the `enhancedFoodProcessByPriority` function:
I've successfully implemented all the improvements from the `智能食物.md` plan:

1. **Improved Risk Assessment**:

   - Added dynamic risk thresholds based on snake length
   - Replaced binary risk decisions with smooth gradient penalties
   - Limited maximum risk penalties to 80%
2. **Enhanced Distance Evaluation and Food Clustering**:

   - Added food cluster recognition to prioritize food-rich areas
   - Implemented dynamic distance weighting based on snake length
   - Used exponential distance functions to better prioritize closer food
3. **Competition Analysis**:

   - Added comprehensive enemy snake competition evaluation
   - Factored in length and position advantages
   - Applied competition penalties to food value calculations
   - Protected the snake from wasteful food competitions
4. **Unified Food Processing System**:

   - Created a single comprehensive food processing function
   - Implemented dynamic priority configurations based on snake state
   - Unified all food evaluation into a cohesive strategy

These improvements should make your snake much smarter about food collection by:

1. Being more nuanced in its risk assessment
2. Recognizing and navigating toward food-rich areas
3. Avoiding fruitless competition with other snakes
4. Adapting food collection strategies based on snake length and game phase

The implementation carefully preserves the existing shield usage constraints while adding these food collection improvements.
